The ingress resources can be routed to a default backend which routes the traffic to the node port or (ip for fargate)
or a ingress rule which wit=ll route the traffic based on rules


It looks like you've provided annotations for an AWS ALB (Application Load Balancer) Ingress controller in a Kubernetes environment. These annotations provide configuration settings for the ALB Ingress controller, specifying how the load balancer should handle health checks and routing for incoming traffic.

Here's a breakdown of the annotations and their purposes:

    -alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/load-balancer-name: app1ingress
    Specifies the name of the load balancer associated with the Ingress.

    -alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme: internet-facing
     Sets the scheme of the load balancer to internet-facing, meaning it can be accessed from the internet.

    -alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/healthcheck-protocol: HTTP
        Specifies that HTTP protocol should be used for health checks.

    -alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/healthcheck-port: traffic-port
        Defines the port on which the health checks should be performed. Here, it uses the traffic-port,
        which typically means the same port that the Ingress is listening on.

    -alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/healthcheck-path: /app1/index.html
        Sets the path to be used for the health check. In this case, it's checking the `/app1/index.html` path.

    -alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/healthcheck-interval-seconds: '15'
        Specifies the interval in seconds between health checks. Health checks will be
        performed every 15 seconds in this configuration.

    -alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/healthcheck-timeout-seconds: '5'
        Sets the timeout in seconds for health checks. If the health check does not receive a response within 5 seconds,
        it will be considered a failure.

    -alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/success-codes: '200'
         Defines the HTTP status codes that indicate a successful health check.
         Here, a response with a status code of 200 is considered healthy.

    -alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/healthy-threshold-count: '2'
        Specifies the number of consecutive successful health checks required to mark an unhealthy target as healthy.
        Here, 2 consecutive successful checks are needed.

    -alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/unhealthy-threshold-count: '2'
         Sets the number of consecutive failures required to mark a healthy target as unhealthy.
         Here, 2 consecutive failures will mark the target as unhealthy.
