ALB is a super advanced, next generation Load Balancer in AWS

It supports both path and route based routing

It supports routing based on the type of request


ALB Ingress Controller:
    This is just like Nginx Ingress controller, however, this one is peculiar to
    AWS. It will trigger ALB for all the svc you want.


    It supports two traffic modes

    - Instance
        Registers nodes within the cluster as target group for the alb.
        Traffic is routed to the NodePort of the svc
        It is the default

        annotations:
            alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type: instance

    - IP
        Registers pods as target groups
        This is used for fargate serverless


        annotations:
            alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type: ip
