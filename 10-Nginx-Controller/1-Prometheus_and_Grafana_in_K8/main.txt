Prometheus and Grafana are popular open-source tools used in the field of monitoring and observability.
They are often used together to monitor and visualize the performance and health of systems, applications, and infrastructure.

1. Prometheus:
   - Type: Monitoring and alerting system.
   - Purpose: Prometheus is designed for monitoring and alerting. It collects metrics from configured targets at
     specified intervals, evaluates rule expressions, displays the results, and can trigger alerts if certain conditions
      are met. It is particularly well-suited for dynamic cloud environments and container orchestration systems like Kubernetes.

   - Key Features:
      - Time-series data storage.
      - Query language (PromQL) for extracting and analyzing metrics.
      - Service discovery for automatically finding and monitoring targets.
      - Alerting and notification based on defined rules.
      - Pull-based model for scraping metrics from monitored targets.

2. Grafana:
   - Type: Data visualization and analytics platform.
   - Purpose: Grafana is used for creating, exploring, and sharing interactive and customizable dashboards.
     It supports various data sources, including Prometheus, and allows users to build visualizations and panels
     to represent complex data in a human-readable format. Grafana is commonly used to create dashboards that display
     metrics collected by Prometheus.

   - Key Features:
      - Support for multiple data sources, including Prometheus, Graphite, Elasticsearch, and more.
      - Flexible and extensible dashboard creation with a wide variety of panels and visualizations.
      - Templating for dynamic dashboards.
      - Alerting and notification integrations.
      - User authentication and access control.

Integration:
   - Prometheus and Grafana are often used together to provide a comprehensive monitoring and visualization solution.
     Prometheus collects and stores time-series data, and Grafana retrieves and visualizes this data through dashboards.
     This combination allows users to gain insights into the performance and health of their systems, troubleshoot issues,
     and set up alerts for proactive monitoring.

Typical Workflow:
   1. Prometheus scrapes metrics from configured targets.
   2. Prometheus stores the collected metrics in its time-series database.
   3. Grafana connects to Prometheus as a data source.
   4. Users create dashboards in Grafana, pulling in data from Prometheus.
   5. Dashboards provide visualizations and insights into the monitored systems.

Together, Prometheus and Grafana form a powerful monitoring and visualization stack that is widely used in the DevOps
and SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) communities.
